This Folder contains Data Mining labs and a project I did with classmates
I worked on the modeling process which includes the Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes methods. 
The labs were conducted mostly after covered each methodology and for the final project we used what we learned in class to solve our own problems based on the dataset we chose. 
For the Final Project we decided to work with a crimes dataset from the years 1980 - 2014. 
This dataset can be found on kaggle and you can use this link as well. https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports.
