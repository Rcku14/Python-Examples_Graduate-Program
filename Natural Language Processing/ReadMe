This folder contains all the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Assignments I had for class. 
These assignments include an introductory to importing text data, doing preprocessing such as lowering case words, removining duplicates and stopwords,etc.
Lastly, there is also a final project which we do text summarization using different extractive and abstractive techniques. 
Will make updates to the files as I find new ways to answer the questions.
